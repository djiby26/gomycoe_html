				<h2>About</h2>

				<p>
					What can a “full-stack web developer” do, you ask? I can conjur a
					website from nothing into existence, fully formed. I do not use
					tricks, nor is this magic. I specialize in manipulating the very
					fabric of the web, its raw materials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
					SVG. Linux servers serve me, domains are my domain, and certificates
					are certain. Open-source technologies empower this process. I am a
					custom WordPress theme and plugin development expert. I fully embraced
					the Gutenberg editor and can create custom blocks from scratch for any
					conceivable need. I have contributed in small ways to these and other
					open-source efforts and intend to give back every chance I get. My art
					& design background informs ideation to design through to
					implementation. In 2010 I graduated from the Cleveland Institute of
					Art with a focus on digital arts and a mantra to always consider my
					audience. I will always advocate for the user of my interfaces;
					accessibility is not optional. I can plan, design, build, launch, and
					maintain a website myself—did I mention that I build mobile apps too?
					I have worked on 10+ published cross-platform iOS and Android apps
					with React Native and Titanium SDK, roughly half of which I built and
					maintain solo. A full-stack developer knows no bounds. And when they
					find one they cross it without hesitation, boldly going into the
					unknown to return richer for it.

					What is a Web Developer? Are you interested in building and
					maintaining websites with the client and consumer in mind? You may
					want to consider a career as a web developer! Web developers are
					responsible for programming the code that 'tells' a website how to
					function. They build websites that are 'user friendly', which means
					they are easy to navigate for those using them. They also build
					functions within a website — for example, a form to capture an e-mail
					or to provide a newsletter, a paywall to capture payment details, or a
					message to thank a customer for their business.

				<h2>Resume</h2>
				<p>
					I use HTML & CSS (usually SASS) every day, and I try to keep up with
					the latest features while maintaining graceful degradation. I use
					JavaScript fairly often, usually with jQuery. I also run Node.js-based
					workflow automation via Gulp or Grunt for web projects, and I’ve
					written other Node scripts to automate mundane tasks. My main
					server-side language is PHP, quite often paired with MySQL. I usually
					use WordPress for client sites, depending on requirements. I
					specialize in custom themes, and have also built custom plugins for
					unique functionality. I’ve developed several iOS and Android apps,
					both using native code and a JavaScript-based framework called
					Titanium SDK. I learned ActionScript 3.0 when it first came out, when
					Flash was still ubiquitous and mobile devices were scarce. I’ve also
					dabbled with Haxe during Ludum Dare challenges. I use Git for all of
					my programming work. Check out my GitHub page for random projects and
					contributions to other open source projects. I primarily use GitHub’s
					Atom text editor for coding. I maintain my own Linux server at home
					(Ubuntu) that acts as a staging site for project websites. DESIGN I
					have professional experience with Adobe Creative Suite up to the
					latest versions, especially XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign,
					AfterEffects, and the ExtendScript Toolkit. My web design process
					usually involves wireframing, a few rough sketches, and then a
					prototype that, over several iterations, becomes the final design.
