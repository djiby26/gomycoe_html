				What can a “full-stack web developer” do, you ask? I can conjur a
				website from nothing into existence, fully formed. I do not use tricks,
				nor is this magic. I specialize in manipulating the very fabric of the
				web, its raw materials of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG. Linux servers
				serve me, domains are my domain, and certificates are certain.
				Open-source technologies empower this process. I am a custom WordPress
				theme and plugin development expert. I fully embraced the Gutenberg
				editor and can create custom blocks from scratch for any conceivable
				need. I have contributed in small ways to these and other open-source
				efforts and intend to give back every chance I get. My art & design
				background informs ideation to design through to implementation. In 2010
				I graduated from the Cleveland Institute of Art with a focus on digital
				arts and a mantra to always consider my audience. I will always advocate
				for the user of my interfaces; accessibility is not optional. I can
				plan, design, build, launch, and maintain a website myself—did I mention
				that I build mobile apps too? I have worked on 10+ published
				cross-platform iOS and Android apps with React Native and Titanium SDK,
				roughly half of which I built and maintain solo. A full-stack developer
				knows no bounds. And when they find one they cross it without
				hesitation, boldly going into the unknown to return richer for it.
