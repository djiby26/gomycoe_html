				What is a Web Developer? Are you interested in building and maintaining
				websites with the client and consumer in mind? You may want to consider
				a career as a web developer! Web developers are responsible for
				programming the code that 'tells' a website how to function. They build
				websites that are 'user friendly', which means they are easy to navigate
				for those using them. They also build functions within a website â€” for
				example, a form to capture an e-mail or to provide a newsletter, a
				paywall to capture payment details, or a message to thank a customer for
				their business.
