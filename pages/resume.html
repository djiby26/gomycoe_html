				I use HTML & CSS (usually SASS) every day, and I try to keep up with the
				latest features while maintaining graceful degradation. I use JavaScript
				fairly often, usually with jQuery. I also run Node.js-based workflow
				automation via Gulp or Grunt for web projects, and I’ve written other
				Node scripts to automate mundane tasks. My main server-side language is
				PHP, quite often paired with MySQL. I usually use WordPress for client
				sites, depending on requirements. I specialize in custom themes, and
				have also built custom plugins for unique functionality. I’ve developed
				several iOS and Android apps, both using native code and a
				JavaScript-based framework called Titanium SDK. I learned ActionScript
				3.0 when it first came out, when Flash was still ubiquitous and mobile
				devices were scarce. I’ve also dabbled with Haxe during Ludum Dare
				challenges. I use Git for all of my programming work. Check out my
				GitHub page for random projects and contributions to other open source
				projects. I primarily use GitHub’s Atom text editor for coding. I
				maintain my own Linux server at home (Ubuntu) that acts as a staging
				site for project websites. DESIGN I have professional experience with
				Adobe Creative Suite up to the latest versions, especially XD,
				Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, AfterEffects, and the ExtendScript
				Toolkit. My web design process usually involves wireframing, a few rough
				sketches, and then a prototype that, over several iterations, becomes
				the final design. EDUCATION CLEVELAND INSTITUTE OF ART BFA IN DIGITAL
